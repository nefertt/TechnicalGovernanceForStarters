Project Overview:
Name of Project - Technical Governance For Starters
Dream Idea which sparked this project - The need for traceability of changes made in org.

Project Summary
The organisations especially small ones and non profits quite often do not follow the basic governance practice when doing changes on their Salesforce orgs.
We want to introduce a product which would allow enforcing essential best practices for making Salesforce metadata changes.
Whenever anyone does the change on org they would HAVE to follow simple process to put the reason of the change.
